# SmartCribGuardian
SmartCribGuardian uses YOLOv9 to monitor babies in real-time. It detects if the baby leaves the crib, drawing bounding boxes and sending alerts. Includes webcam capture, crib zone configuration, and modular code design, making it easy to extend with notifications, logging, or sound alarms.
